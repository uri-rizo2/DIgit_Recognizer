# DIgit_Recognizer
Digit Recognizer using Convolutional Neural Networks: This repository contains an implementation of a digit recognizer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits. It includes code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization. The repository also showcases visualizations of training accuracy, loss, and sample predictions. The digit recognizer achieves high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits, demonstrating the power of CNNs in computer vision tasks. This project serves as a valuable addition to your portfolio, showcasing your skills in deep learning and image classification.
